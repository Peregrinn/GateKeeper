Gate Keeper is a Random Password Generator that will automatically create a txt file that will save the password! This also allows you to save your email address along with the password. (**and no this is NOT a password stealer.** I could care less about your email and passwords.) 

Gate Keeper is now an executable file. 

For the people that may ask, Where is v.2? - *v.2 was so buggy that I didn't even wanna bother releasing it.* yeah that's all to it. 

**CUSTOMIZATION** For v.5.1

username= For personal preference.

spacer= The divider between the saved password and email.

color= You can change the color of the text to Gate Keeper. 


**REQUIREMENTS** For v.5.1
